# Text-Based-Adventure-Game
A text based adventure RPG I am making on the side while learning the main components of Python. You go around as the player, killing enemies, gathering resources, surviving the days and nights by going on quests to get enough money in a certain time span (in game days) before the final day for a final boss fight at the end. The game is no where near finished but this is the objective of the game and you also get to explore the story of the wider areas of the island the game is set in.

Currently, the game does not have most of these features mentioned above but will be implemented later in the future. Currently, it has a simple turn-based battle system, xp system (levelling included), map system, narrative system, sometimes you get options on what to do in certain scenarios, a few enemies and a few other stuff. 

I am planning later on to integrate pygame into this and also introduce virtual environments (which I should have done from the beginning but you know how it is). I have spent around 8 months of school breaks on this side project and plan to finish it (hopefully) with inventory systems, bosses, day light system, quest system, map system and a few more features.

If you do plan to download the repo to play the game, then the instructions are as such:
1. Download the repo
2. Open it in your code editor of choice
3. Run the "Game.py" file in your terminal
4. Enjoy the game!

When I am done with this project, I will be putting it on Itch or some other game publishing platform and will probably make the game open source, but for now, I'll keep it as it is. Please give me advice or ideas or your opinion on it if you do download the "beta" version of this game, but be ready to be playing a disaster of a game.

Thanks for reading!
