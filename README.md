# Text-Based-Adventure-Game
A text based adventure RPG I am making on the side while learning the main components of Python. I am planning later on to integrate pygame into this and also introduce virtual environments (which I should have done from the beginning but you know how it is). I have spent around 8 months of school breaks on this side project and plan to finish it.
